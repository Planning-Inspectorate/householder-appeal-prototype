We have to be sure they've notified.
We can do this on the day of the appeal.
We give them chance to sort it out.

"We just need to know who owns the land".
Who owns the land?

I am the sole owner
I am a shared owner - (tells us who else owns the land)
Certificate B is the tricky one. Let's look at this.

Has anyone moved out basically.




We need green balt and listed building I think - because there are two appeals!?
WHY ARE THERE TWO DECISIONS???

LISTED BUILDING IS OUT OF SCOPE - but needs to be asked.


make a HAS appeal,
make a listed building appeal
we see them as linked together and take them out of HAS.
