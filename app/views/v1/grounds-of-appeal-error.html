          <div class="govuk-details__text">
            <p>When you appeal, the Planning Inspectorate looks at whether the Local Planning Authority (LPA) correctly applied the planning regulations to your original planning application.</p>
            <p>To support your appeal, you can write a grounds of appeal statement, which sets out why you think the LPA’s decision was incorrect. This is optional. If you do not upload a statement, the Planning Inspectorate will make a decision by looking at how the LPA applied the planning regulations to your application.</p>
            <p>If you think there is relevant information that would support your appeal, this is the opportunity to highlight it to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>
            <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Reasons for refusal</h4>
            <p>The first step is to read the LPA’s decision notice, where they list their reasons for refusing the planning application. Each reason for refusal will mention the planning regulation the LPA based their decision on. If you think the LPA reason/s for refusal is incorrect, list your evidence in your statement.</p>
            <p>For example: the LPA refused your application on the grounds of the proposal’s detrimental effect on the neighbours, but you have checked the relevant planning regulation and do not think this is correct according to your measurements.</p>

            <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Details of other relevant applications/appeals</h4>
            <p>If there are other appeals being considered for the same site, or similar proposals or appeals for sites in the local area, and they support your appeal, you should list them in your grounds of appeal. If possible, identify them on a street map with their addresses.
              <strong>For example:</strong> your neighbour appealed a refusal for a similar proposal and was successful.</p>

            <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Supporting grounds of appeal documents</h4>
            <p>You will be able to upload any documents that you think support your grounds of appeal – this could be photographs of the site in relation to its neighbours, or excerpts of relevant planning regulations that the LPA did not refer to. If you plan to upload any supporting documents, you should refer to them in your grounds of appeal statement and explain why they are relevant.</p>

            <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Responding to comments from interested parties</h4>
            <p>There may have been comments from interested parties on the original planning application. If you think these unreasonably influenced the LPA to refuse your planning application, refer to them here and explain why you do not think they are relevant.</p>
            <p>For example: interested parties commented on the planning application that the proposal would affect the character of the local area, but you know that other nearby properties have had similar proposals approved.</p>
