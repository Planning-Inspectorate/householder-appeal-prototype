        You can tell us your reasons for appealing in your appeal statement. This is the only opportunity to appeal your planning decision.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll need to write and upload a statement during the appeal process that explains why you think the local planning department's decision is incorrect. You'll need to respond to all the reasons for refusal (listed on the decision letter from your local planning department), and include any other information that supports your appeal.

            When you appeal, the Planning Inspectorate looks at whether the local planning department (also referred to as 'Local Planning Authority' or 'LPA') correctly applied the relevant planning policies to your original planning application.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            The decision will be based on the local planning department's development plan, which can be found on the local planning department's website. 
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            When deciding whether a planning application is in line with the development plan, they may have taken into account some or all of the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              the possible impact on the surrounding area

              the proposed use of the development
            </li>
            <li>
              the number, size, layout, position and external appearance of buildings

        Reasons for refusal
      </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The first step is to read the local planning department's decision letter, where they list their reasons for refusing the planning application. Each reason for refusal will mention the planning policy their decision is based on, and may also refer to additional planning documents.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You should also read the planning officer's report, and any planning committee meeting notes (if applicable). If you think the local planning department's decision to refuse your application is incorrect, explain why in your statement.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Supporting documents 
      </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you refer to any documents, for example photographs, in your appeal statement you need to explain why you think they are relevant in your statement and then upload them in the next step.

        Responding to comments from interested parties
      </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        There may have been comments (also called 'representations from interested parties’) on the original planning application. You can respond to them in your appeal statement if you want to.

        Sensitive information
      </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        We only collect sensitive information to the extent it is relevant to an appeal.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your appeal statement should set out why the local planning department's decision was incorrect. You should refer to the policies they used in their decision, and their development plan.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You may choose to include sensitive information in your appeal statement. Think carefully about whether any sensitive information you provide is necessary and relevant to your case.

        Your appeal and appeal statement will be shared with your local planning department.
